# Utrecht-Regression
In the pursuit of formulating a prognostic framework for the market valuation of residences within the Utechert locale, the focal point rests upon delineating the retail worth as the reliant variable. Diverse factors serve as the autonomous variables within this framework, encompassing attributes such as “lot.len”, “lot.width”, “lot.area”, “buildyear”, “taxvalue”, “zipcode”, “monument”, “energyeff”, “bedroom”, “bathrooms”, and “balcony”. </h1>
